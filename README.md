# animacaocss

Hello.

Before we talk about the project, I want to say that I am still new to the area and I am learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

This simple animation I created was only to practice what I've been learning in the course. 
This small project was done with keyframes in css. The code is available for you to access and give the opinion. 

Thank you!
